Worksheets_Picker is a excel add-in. Allow you to customize the worksheets to hide or show with a single click of button.
E.g I have a report that has 10 worksheets. Before submitting the report to my manager, I will like to hide 8 of the worksheets.
Imagine i have 100 of such reports, and i have to manually repeat the hiding for each report.

However, with this add-in, you can create a menu button, such that with a single click, the appropriate worksheets 
will be hidden and yes! you can customize what worksheet names to hide before you create this menu button.

Better still, you can create as many menu buttons as possible, each button show/hide a set of worksheets predefined by you!
